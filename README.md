# Tablestrap
GroceryCRUD bootstrap themes. Modified from original GroceryCRUD datatables theme.
I created this in my free time. Basicaly I took GroceryCRUD datatables theme and mix it with DataTables bootstrap theme.
then I added pnotify as a bonus. I don't change some input plugins that GroceryCRUD using like jQuery chosen for select,
and ckeditor. This theme currently feels rather lag, maybe I will add some loader animation while DataTables loading up.

## Installation
Clone or Download this project. Copy to your GroceryCRUD theme folder. usually it's located at:
```
    ~/assets/grocery_crud/themes/[copy_here]
```

## Dependencies
Ofcourse you need CodeIgniter and GroceryCRUD right. I tested this theme with [CodeIgniter version 3.1.8](https://www.codeigniter.com/) and [GroceryCRUD version 1.6.1](https://www.grocerycrud.com/).

For Bootstrap, using [Bootstrap 3.3](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/).

For DataTables version :
* jQuery DataTables version 1.10.16
* DataTables Bootstrap version 1.10.16

here is the related documentation of [DataTables Bootstrap Styling](https://datatables.net/examples/styling/bootstrap)

For [Pnotify](https://github.com/sciactive/pnotify), using version 3 the stable version.
